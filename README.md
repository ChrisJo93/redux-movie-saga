Welcome to Movie Master!

Movie Master comes with three page views. The first page, homepage, is a selection of movies. Users on the homepage can see the title of the movie, its description, and a poster image. Clicking on the poster image will send the user to the second page, the details page, that has the selected movie, its information, along with its given genres.

From the details page the user can click "return to movie list" to return to the homepage.

The third page, the add movie page, is a form field where users can input title, poster image source, description, and select which genre the movie falls in. Clicking save will capture the inputs and send them to the database as well as sending the user back to the homepage where their new input will be located at the bottom.

The user can also click cancel on the add movie page to return to the homepage.
